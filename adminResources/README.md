# CSCI3308_DogProject
## Final Project for CSCI 3308
---


## Description
---
This website will serve as a dog adoption portal for the general public. The website will display different dogs available for adoption, for each dog users will be able to see information about their name, breed, size, location, etc. Users will also be able to leave and read reviews for each shelter as well as directly message shelters.

The website will also have other resources for adoption like articles/tips for caring for dogs, a small pet store and a quiz to match users with a dog breed.
